# Acronyn Generator (working title)

## Description
This is the current project repository for an acronym generator.  A user will input
words to describe something, and the app will take those words and synonyms of those
words and combine them to create acronyms that are also words.  Users will be able 
to browse these acronyms and word lists.  If they log in, they can choose their
favorite acronyms and word lists to be saved to their profile.  They can also flag
acronyms that they don't believe are words.
